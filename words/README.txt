Coding

1. Write a program in any programming language that counts backwards from value provided by user to 1 and
prints: “Agile” if the number is divisible by 5, “Software” if the
number is divisible by 3, “Testing” if the number is divisible by both,
or prints just the number if none of those cases are true.
